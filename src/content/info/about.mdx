# Blog template

Get the [source code here](https://github.com/nhonvo/algo-blog)

Minimalistic but opinionated blog template using [astro](https://astro.build/) and [svelte](https://svelte.dev/).
aims to be super easy to deploy and use, with a focus on performance and SEO, ease-of-use and design
(see all [features here](/algo-blog/posts/features)).

This blog doubles as a tutorial on how to use this template, start by [reading the quickstart](/algo-blog/posts/how-to-use),
then [add some content](/algo-blog/posts/adding-content).

If you want to, I'd appreciate it if you add something like this here (not required):
